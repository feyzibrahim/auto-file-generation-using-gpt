I. PURPOSE
To define and describe the accepted indications and treatment protocols for patients with Chronic Heart Failure (CHF), including the management of associated conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. This policy also includes guidelines for medication coverage, procedural approvals, diagnostic test approvals, and specific conditions or restrictions.

II. INDICATIONS FOR USE/INCLUSION CRITERIA
A. Hospital Stay Duration

The maximum approved duration of hospital stay is 5 days for CHF patients unless complications arise that require extended hospitalization. Approval for an extended stay must be sought with detailed clinical justification.
B. Medication Coverage

Generic medications are preferred. Coverage for brand-name medications such as Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) will only be approved if clinically justified due to intolerance or lack of efficacy of generic alternatives.

Approved Medications:

Lisinopril (10-40 mg daily)
Metoprolol Succinate (50-200 mg daily)
Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) (as prescribed)
Furosemide (as needed for fluid management)
Spironolactone (25-50 mg daily)
Digoxin (as needed for heart rate control)
Ivabradine (as needed for heart rate control)
C. Procedural Coverage

Pre-approved procedures include:
Echocardiograms
Chest X-rays
Cardiac catheterization (if indicated)

B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) levels
Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)
Complete Blood Count (CBC)
Liver Function Tests (LFTs)
Electrocardiogram (ECG)

E. Post-Discharge Care

Patients are required to have a follow-up visit within 7 days post-discharge.
Participation in heart failure rehabilitation programs is recommended and covered if initiated within 30 days of discharge.
F. Lifestyle and Preventive Measures

Smoking cessation programs are covered for patients with a history of smoking.
Nutritional consultations are covered for patients with CHF and dietary management needs.
III. EXCLUSION CRITERIA

Medications not directly related to CHF management, unless there is a documented need, will not be covered.
C. Procedural Exclusions

Experimental or investigational procedures not supported by clinical guidelines will not be covered.
Repeat procedures without clear clinical justification for recurrence or progression will not be covered.
D. Use of Non-Related Diagnostic Tests

Diagnostic tests unrelated to the patient's primary diagnosis of CHF, unless required to address a complication, will not be covered.
E. Advanced Imaging without Justification

Advanced imaging (e.g., CT, MRI) for heart evaluation will not be covered if simpler diagnostic tools (e.g., echocardiogram) suffice.
F. Non-Essential Post-Discharge Care

Non-essential post-discharge treatments or follow-ups, such as routine visits not directly tied to the patientâ€™s heart condition, will not be covered.
G. Out-of-Network Services

Services provided by out-of-network providers without prior authorization will not be covered.
